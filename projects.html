                    <p>About project:</p> 
                    <p>Simulation idle game based on the works of writer H.P. Lovecraft. The game is being developed with the game engine Godot, which features a scripting
                        language similar to python, although C++ or C# are also supported. The user interface consists of a display for the buildings and information about 
                        the resources a player has earned. The player can modify some aspects of the management of the buildings and see more detailed information about the game 
                        by clicking on a building or clicking the menu button, both of which display more options. 
                        The features (some pending) include:</p>
                        <p>- Gather resources, build and upgrade buildings. </p>
                        <p>- Send followers to expeditions to recover ancient items and resources </p>
                        <p>- Defend cult from outside and inside threats</p>
                        <p>- Minigame similar to minesweeper that helps the player progress</p>

                    <p>About project:</p> 
                    <p>Application developed in collaboration with 5 other students for a software engineering course at the University of California San Diego. 
                        The process was based on the Agile methodology and included a planning phase, design, development and testing. The team had stand up meetings at the beginning or ending of a class
                        and also met once or twice a week for pair programming and other tasks. Planning phase including reading the requirements, activities like
                        planning poker, creating user stories, test cases and tasks divided by phases. My tasks included testing and development.
                    </p>
                    <p>Description: Allows users to input the coordinates of places and share their locations with other users so that the
                    locations are displayed on a user interface that resembles a compass (circular view). The location updates in real time and users can set custom
                    labels on the interface.
