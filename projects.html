                <p>About project:</p> 
                <p>Application developed in collaboration with 5 other students for a software engineering course at the University of California San Diego. 
                    The process included a planning phase, design, development and testing. The team had stand up meetings at the beginning or ending of a class
                    and also met once or twice a week for pair programming and other tasks. Planning phase including reading the requirements, activities like
                    planning poker, creating user stories, test cases and tasks divided by phases. My tasks included testing and development.
                </p>
                <p>Description: Allows users to input the coordinates of places and share their locations with other users so that the
                 locations are displayed on a user interface that resembles a compass (circular view). The location updates in real time and users can set custom
                 labels on the interface.
