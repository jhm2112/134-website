            <h3> About me </h3>
            <p id="aboutMe"> 
                Hi, I'm Jorge Hernandez and I recently graduated from the University of California San Diego, where
                I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I'm currently looking for job opportunities in the software industry, anywhere in the US. </br></br>
                <strong>Skills:</strong> While I do have experience with specific languages, like Java, C++ and Javascript and other tools, 
                the approach at UCSD was to prepare students with a strong theoretical foundation in many areas of Computer Science that allows for an easier transition to most languages or
                technologies that are currently being used. I also have some projects (see my project tab) and I will continue to work on other stuff
                now that I have more time. Some projects I've done while in college include websites, an android application, and smaller programs 
                that I wrote for a Databases course.
